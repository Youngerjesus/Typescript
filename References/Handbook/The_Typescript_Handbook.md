## The Typescript Handbook
***

### About this Handboook 
while the size, scope, and complexity of programs written in JavaScript has grown exponentially, the ability of the JavaScript language to express the relationships between different units of code has not. Combined with JavaScript’s rather peculiar runtime semantics, this mismatch between language and program complexity has made JavaScript development a difficult task to manage at scale.

### How is this Handbook Structured

The handbook is split into two sections:

- The Handbook
  
You should expect each chapter or page to provide you with a strong understanding of the given concepts. The TypeScript Handbook is not a complete language specification, but it is intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of the language’s features and behaviors.

A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:

- Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns
- Explain the effects of important compiler options
- Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases
- Write a .d.ts declaration for a simple function, object, or class

- <div style="font-weight: bold"> The Handbook Reference </div>
The handbook reference is built to provide a richer understanding of how a particular part of TypeScript works. You can read it top-to-bottom, but each section aims to provide a deeper explanation of a single concept - meaning there is no aim for continuity.

Specifically, the Handbook does not fully introduce core JavaScript basics like functions, classes, and closures. Where appropriate, we’ll include links to background reading that you can use to read up on those concepts.
